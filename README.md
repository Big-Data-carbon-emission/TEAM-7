# Atmospheric Pollutant Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing atmospheric pollutants, including Methane (CH₄), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂), and Gross Primary Production (GPP). The analysis is performed using Python, with data manipulation and visualization facilitated by `pandas` and `seaborn`.

## Project Overview

The primary objectives of this project are to:

- **Data Collection**: Gather atmospheric pollutant data from reliable sources.
- **Data Processing**: Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Explore relationships and trends among the pollutants and GPP.
- **Data Visualization**: Create informative visualizations to represent the findings.

## Features

- Import and manage data using `pandas`.
- Visualize data distributions and relationships with `seaborn`.
- Analyze correlations between different pollutants and GPP.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the following packages:

- `pandas`
- `seaborn`

You can install these packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn
